Library Manager is a client database program designed to manage the issuance of books for a school library. The application includes features such as managing history, adding and removing items, and a system for reserving books for varying durations. The project as a whole is a component of a submission into the Future Business Leaders of America's *Coding & Programming* competition, the specific requirements for which were listed [on their website (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180217192136im_/http://www.fbla-pbl.org:80/competitive-event/coding-programming/). A functioning copy is [available here](https://github.com/jazevedo620/LibraryManager/releases/latest) (runnable on the .NET runtime).

## üèõ Underlying Architecture

As part of the design guidelines, Library Manager is a Client database programmed designed to be connected to a centralized database server. Instead of locally serving the database, the demo provided under Releases uses a sample dataset in order to showcase functionality.

Internally, Library Manager takes advantage of Microsoft's flagship .NET UI framework, Windows Presentation Foundation, or WPF. WPF works through two components: the design is programmed in **XAML**, or Extensible Application Markup Language (*different from XML*), while the behavior is programmed in **C#**. This separation of *design* and *behavior* is key to the framework's architecture, as it allows for the adoption of the Model-View-ViewModel design paradigm as outlined below.

## üìö Documentation

Extensible documentation was developed via LaTeX in order to explain each feature of the program, and is available as a [PDF document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rzvxD1XwVbWNX5nE0kkMXI031g4EwGW_).
